   SPONSOR DATA — 2026-27 season
   =====================================================================
   Edit this array to add/remove/update sponsors. No other file needs
   to change for a normal update.

   Fields per sponsor:
     name     (required) — sponsor/company name
     tier     (required) — "diamond" | "gold" | "silver" | "supporter"
     link     (optional) — the ONE primary URL the whole card opens.
                            Website for almost everyone; Instagram for
                            sponsors who only have a social page.
     logo     (optional) — path to logo file in assets/logos/.
                            Leave blank/omit to show a placeholder box
                            with initials until a logo is supplied.
     cardBg   (optional) — "white" | "black" — forces the tile behind
                            the logo to that colour, for logos that
                            need a specific background to read clearly.
                            Leave unset for the default (transparent,
                            sits directly on the dark page background).

   TO DUPLICATE FOR A NEW SEASON (e.g. 2027-28):
     1. Copy this file to assets/js/sponsors-2027-28.js
     2. Copy 2026-27.html to 2027-28.html
     3. In the new HTML file, update the <script src> to point at the
        new data file, and update the season text in the header.
     4. Edit the sponsor list below in the new data file.
